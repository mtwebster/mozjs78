mozjs78 (78.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload

  [ Marco Trevisan (Treviño) ]
  * New upstream version 78.2.0 (Closes: #968341)
    - Rename source to mozjs78
    - debian/gbp.conf: Set debian and upstream branches to match version
    - debian/watch: Update main version regex
  * debian/control:
    - Add back rust and LLVM dependencies:
      mozjs can't be compiled anymore without rust built sources, at least not
      without some huge changes that aren't suitable for a distro-patch, so
      let's add back rustc and cargo as dependencies.
      This also implies some libraries checks that are performed using llvm
      tools, so including it as well.
    - Bump dependency on debhelper 13
    - Bump build dependency to ICU 63.1-4 (tests need debian specific version,
      see bug #968609)
    - Use python3 (and drop python2.7) (Closes: #956334)
    - Update Vcs-* flags to match branches
  * debian/rules:
    - Only use python3
    - Don't set ICU_DATA_FILE as mozilla build system already handles it
    - Use GNOME suggested configure parameters
    - Factorize the code to compute just once the VERSIONED_LIBNAME
    - Export MOZJS_VERSION to be used in install files
    - Use thin LTO in rust (via RUSTFLAGS) for riscv64
    - Ensure rust follows debian compilation settings
    - Set CARGO_HOME to a builddir subdirectory
  * debian/test.sh:
    - Use python3 to run jit tests
    - Run again make check-jstests (it was wrongly removed)
    - Don't redefine HOME. This is now handled by default by debhelper 13
  * debian/*.install: Use debhelper 13 variables sobstitutions to match files
  * debian/README.source: Add doc to explain how we generate the orig file
  * debian/source/lintian-overrides:
    - Ignore missing signature on source tarball
    - Ignore errors on files with very long lines
  * debian/gbp.conf:
    - Remove filters as they are now handled by the repack script
  * debian/gbp-repack-mozjs-source.sh:
    - Only support gbp versions that repack the orig file using the content
      generated by the postunpack hook
    - Add ability to copy more files into the git archive from firefox
      sources, and include the ICU sources to allow builds without system ICU.
    - Add ability to filter files, and remove Files-Excluded from
      debian/copyright (in case gbp imports an orig file without uscan).
    - Delete empty directories in mozjs sources (as git will ignore them)
  * debian/libmozjs-78-0.docs: Include NOTICE file from 3rd party pkcs11
  * debian/patches: Refresh for mozjs78
  * d/p/Bug-1545437-Add-options-to-specify-Rust-target-name.patch:
    - Refreshed to apply in new version, we still need to set RUST_TARGET
  * d/p/Bug-1661094-Always-define-PKGCONF_REQUIRES_PRIVATE.patch:
    - Ensure we generate a pkg-config file with proper syntax
  * d/p/Remove-unused-LLVM-and-Rust-build-dependencies.patch:
    - Dropped, mozjs now strictly depends on rust (and use llvm tools to check)
  * d/p/tests-Adapt-formatted-strings-results-to-system-ICU.patch:
    - Sync expected test results as per latest system ICU
  * d/p/Add-riscv64-support.patch:
    - Ensure that we find the proper rust target in all the riscv64 variants
    - Ensure we compile with -mabi=lp64d, importing some cc-rs fixes.
  * d/p/icu_sources_data.py-Decouple-from-Mozilla-build-system.patch,
    d/p/icu_sources_data-Write-command-output-to-our-stderr.patch:
    - Add back icu sources data patches, they were wrongly removed, even if
      they aren't currently used, they might be useful if internal ICU is
      wanted for backport reasons.

  [ Dimitri John Ledkov ]
  * Disable CET protection in mozjs, until after JIT is ported upstream.

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * d/copyright: Update
  * d/p/Skip-another-timezone-related-test-that-fails-with-system.patch:
    Add a patch to skip another timezone-related test with system ICU

mozjs68 (68.9.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Marco Trevisan (Treviño) ]
  * New upstream release

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Remove rust and LLVM dependencies for better portability.
    Thanks to John Paul Adrian Glaubitz (Closes: #959144)
  * Refresh patch series with gbp-pq-style metadata
  * Install as libmozjs-68.so.0, not libmozjs-68.so.68.
    The SONAME is libmozjs-68.so.0, so we need to install the
    libmozjs-68.so.0 symbolic link. In native installations, ldconfig
    would create libmozjs-68.so.0 for us, but when using mozjs68 to
    cross-compile other packages, that won't happen. (Closes: #959792)
  * d/rules: Justify why we skip basic/bug653153.js on i386.
    That test seems to be failing on i386 due to extended precision in the
    i387 FPU. Upstream always builds with -mfpmath=sse and does not support
    use of i387, but that isn't currently allowed in Debian due to our i386
    baseline being 20 years old (in particular no SSE and no SSE2).
  * d/rules: Avoid parsing d/changelog
  * d/rules: Make variable names less confusing.
    Avoid the DEB_ prefix in our own variables, to avoid mixing up
    our DEB_UPSTREAM_VERSION with dpkg's DEB_VERSION_UPSTREAM.

  [ Marco Trevisan (Treviño) ]
  * debian/rules: Properly parse DEB_VERSION_UPSTREAM using shell
  * d/p/Bug-1545437-Add-options-to-specify-Rust-target-name.patch:
    - Dropped, included upstream

  * New upstream release with security fixes:
    - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/68.6.0/releasenotes/

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * d/rules: Swap --host and --target.
    The Mozilla build system's terminology is not the same as Autoconf's,
    and previous versions of the mozjs Debian packages got the translation
    wrong.
  * d/rules: Ask moz.configure to give us more information

mozjs68 (68.5.0-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * rules, test.sh: Allow tests to be excluded by name and exclude
    basic/bug653153.js.  Without more extensive patching, this test can't be
    skipped conditionally based on dpkg architecture. It fails on i386 because
    of a new test that was added in mozjs68 - the behaviour is the same as it
    was previously. This has been reported upstream:

  * debian/patches: Refresh

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * Generate shlibs with a lower bound. 60.2.3-4 is introducing a new symbol.
    We need reverse-deps to have a dependency on this version if they have
    been built with it. After 60.2.3, generate shlibs with -VUpstream-Version,
    so that dependencies are generated in the form >= Upstream-Version. A
    symbols file would be better.
  * debian/control{,.in}: Add tzdata to Depends an B/uild-Depends. The tests
    use ICU and require that this is installed. If it's not, they fail with
    messages like "non262/Date/time-zones.js:41:5 Error: Assertion failed: got

  * Build with system ICU library (Closes: #908554)
    - Leave the patches and workarounds in place, but gate them behind

    - Adapt mozjs52 packaging for major version 60
    - This is a new, parallel source package because the latest upstream
      versions of cjs and policykit-1 currently still require mozjs52
  * Refresh patch series

      Drop, appears to be unnecessary now
    - d/p/Fix-crashes-in-AtomicOperations-none.patch:
      Drop, unknown architectures compiled on gcc/clang now use

      equivalent to the previous sparc/powerpc implementations
    - d/p/alpha-ia64-python-build-fixes.patch, d/p/sparc64-support.patch:

    - d/p/sh4-support.patch, d/p/m68k-support.patch:
      Drop, partially obsoleted by use of
      AtomicOperations-feeling-lucky.h; remaining changes need rebasing
      and re-testing (see #905833 for sh4, #905834 for m68k)
  * Build with srcdir != builddir. This matches the behaviour of GNOME's
    various continuous integration systems, and avoids a FTBFS when
    srcdir = builddir.
  * Explicitly disable jemalloc, which is broken in standalone mozjs
    releases and causes a trivial embedder to segfault. Again, this
    matches the "packaging" in GNOME's continuous integration.

mozjs52 (52.3.1-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Regenerate patches
  * Export SHELL and PYTHON for all stages of the build process
    (Closes: #876354)
  * d/p/Allow-to-override-ICU_DATA_FILE-from-the-environment.patch:
    Add patch from firefox-esr to allow ICU_DATA_FILE to be forced in
    the environment. We need to use a big-endian version on BE
    architectures.
  * d/p/Patch-pregenerated-old-configure-to-match-build-autoconf-.patch:
    Apply the equivalent of that patch to the pregenerated old-configure
    script
  * d/p/Add-intl-icu_sources_data.py-from-firefox-esr.patch:
    Add patch importing intl/icu_sources_data.py from firefox-esr_52.4.0esr-2
    so we can regenerate the ICU_DATA_FILE
  * d/rules: Regenerate the ICU_DATA_FILE (with the correct endianness)
    so the interpreter doesn't fail to initialize on big-endian
    architectures (Closes: #873778)
  * d/p/icu_sources_data.py-Decouple-from-Mozilla-build-system.patch:
    Avoid needing the mozpack module to generate the ICU_DATA_FILE
  * d/p/Fix-crashes-in-AtomicOperations-none-on-s390x.patch:
    Add patch from firefox-esr to fix atomic operations crashes on s390x
  * d/p/icu_sources_data-Write-command-output-to-our-stderr.patch:
    Make sure output from icu_sources_data.py ends up in buildd logs
  * d/p/tests-For-tests-that-are-skipped-on-64-bit-mips64-is-also.patch:
    Count mips64 as a 64-bit architecture for the purposes of skipping
    tests
  * d/rules: Run a "hello, world" program before running the test suite.
    If mozjs fails to initialize on a platform, the diagnostics given
    are fairly useless; try something much simpler before we go to the
    effort of running the full test suite. Failure to run this program
    causes FTBFS, to make sure we won't ship completely useless builds.
  * d/test.sh: Wrap build-time tests, making test-suite failures
    non-fatal on architectures with known issues (downgrades severity
    of: #877428, #878284, #878285, #878286)
  * d/rules: Skip build-time tests if cross-compiling
  * d/rules: Run icu build with VERBOSE=1 to see compilation commands

  [ Jeremy Bicha ]
  * Add Don-t-include-xlocale.patch: Fix build with glibc >= 2.26

      -fno-lifetime-dse-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks" on all architectures.
